# vultr_kubernetes

Get information about a Vultr Kubernetes Engine (VKE) Cluster.

**Note** The node pool deployed with this resource adds its own `tag` which is then used as an identifier for Terraform to see which node pool is part of this resource. 

## Example Usage

Create a new VKE cluster:

```hcl
resource "vultr_kubernetes" "k8" {
  region = "ewr"
  label     = "tf-test"
  version = "v1.20.11+1"

  node_pools {
    node_quantity = 1
    plan = "vc2-2c-4gb"
    label = "my label"
  }
} 
```

## Argument Reference

The follow arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Required) The region your VKE cluster will be deployed in. Currently, supported values are `ewr` and `lax`
* `version` - (Required) The version your VKE cluster you want deployed. [See Available Version](https://www.vultr.com/api/#operation/get-kubernetes-versions)
* `label` - (Optional) The VKE clusters label.


`node_pools` (Required) There must be 1 node pool with the kubernetes resource. It supports the following fields

* `node_quantity` - (Required) The number of nodes in this node pool.
* `plan` - (Required) The plan to be used in this node pool. [See Plans List](https://www.vultr.com/api/#operation/list-plans) Note the minimum plan requirements must have at least 1 core and 2 gbs of memory.
* `label` - (Required) The label to be used as a prefix for nodes in this node pool.
