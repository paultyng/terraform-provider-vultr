# vultr_database_replica

Provides a Vultr database replica resource. This can be used to create, read, modify, and delete managed database read replicas on your Vultr account.

## Example Usage

Create a new database replica:

```hcl
resource "vultr_database_replica" "my_database_replica" {
	database_id = vultr_database.my_database.id
	region = "sea"
    label = "my_database_replica_label"
	tag = "test tag"
}
```

## Argument Reference


~> Updating the database ID will cause a `force new`. This behavior is in place because the parent database cannot be changed without creating a new resource to serve as a read replica for the selected database.

The following arguments are supported:

* `database_id` - (Required) The managed database ID you want to attach this replica to.
* `region` - (Required) The ID of the region that the managed database read replica is to be created in. [See List Regions](https://www.vultr.com/api/#operation/list-regions)
* `label` - (Required) A label for the managed database read replica.
* `tag` - (Optional) The tag to assign to the managed database read replica.
