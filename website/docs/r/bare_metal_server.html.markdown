# vultr_bare_metal_server

Provides a Vultr bare metal server resource. This can be used to create, read, modify, and delete bare metal servers on your Vultr account.

## Example Usage

Create a new bare metal server:

```hcl
resource "vultr_bare_metal_server" "my_server" {
	plan = "vbm-4c-32gb"
	region = "ewr"
	os_id = 1743
}
```

Create a new bare metal server with options:

```hcl
resource "vultr_bare_metal_server" "my_server" {
	plan = "vbm-4c-32gb"
	region = "ewr"
	os_id = 1743
	label = "my-server-label"
	tags = ["my-server-tag"]
	hostname = "my-server-hostname"
	user_data = "this is my user data"
	enable_ipv6 = true
	activation_email = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Required) The ID of the region that the server is to be created in. [See List Regions](https://www.vultr.com/api/#operation/list-regions)

* `image_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Vultr marketplace application to be installed on the server. [See List Applications](https://www.vultr.com/api/#operation/list-applications) Note marketplace applications are denoted by type: `marketplace` and you must use the `image_id` not the id.
* `snapshot_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Vultr snapshot that the server will restore for the initial installation. [See List Snapshots](https://www.vultr.com/api/#operation/list-snapshots)

* `ssh_key_ids` - (Optional) A list of SSH key IDs to apply to the server on install (only valid for Linux/FreeBSD).
* `user_data` - (Optional) Generic data store, which some provisioning tools and cloud operating systems use as a configuration file. It is generally consumed only once after an instance has been launched, but individual needs may vary.
* `enable_ipv6` - (Optional) Whether the server has IPv6 networking activated.
* `activation_email` - (Optional) Whether an activation email will be sent when the server is ready.
* `hostname` - (Optional) The hostname to assign to the server.
